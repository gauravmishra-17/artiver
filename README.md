  <i> Unfortunetely due to my breaking change of path, I am no longer coding in Flutter and Golang, at least not untill 2023. Hence I am not able to actively develop this project no more. <br> <br> <b> Big shotout to everyone who participated in the development process. </b> </i> <br>

  <h2 align="center"> What is ArTiver? </h2>

It is an idea that came to my mind, when I was watching a TikTok during a dinner. I realised that
I could spend this time a lot better. There is uncountable amount of amazing articles about 
programming that surely help with <b> self-improvement. </b> Although, nowadays it is hard to
find an article that will make us want to read it, instead of delivering a dose of dopamine by 
watching Youtube, Tiktok or browsing social media. 

<b> ArTiver </b> will help us with this. This application will give us a possibility,
to create a profile with our interest description and it will deliver best articles focused around them,
from <b> all over the web! </b>
Not only the application will have a possibility to provide relatively best articles, but so do we!

Share your opinion, up/down vote articles, write a review or even write your own article -
everything in one application! Sounds cool, right?

<h3> From developers, for developers! </h3>
  
Ultimately, the project is going to be available on all platforms, taking advantage of the amazing capabilities of the flutter!
  
Real cross-platform experience for developers!
